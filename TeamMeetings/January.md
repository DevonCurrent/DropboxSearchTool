### Robert Bell @ 9:30 A.M.

Went over the prototype built during Winter break, and discussed the API's and code being used. There was a general agreement that we would continue using Python for both the Slack bot and the Dropbox API, since the API is easy to follow and well integrated with both Slack and Dropbox. We agreed to wait on a plan until after Thursday's lecture, in order to understand the requirements and specifications for this course.

We planned to email The Design Gym next week to hold a meeting before the end of the month.
